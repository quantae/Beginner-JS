/** 
 * DOM TREE
 * The backbone of an HTML document is tags.

According to the Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object.
Nested tags are “children” of the enclosing one. The text inside a tag is an object as well.

All these objects are accessible using JavaScript, and we can use them to modify the page.

For example, document.body is the object representing the <body> tag.
